Breaking: Graft no longer runs an oracle. `graft sync` checks that each graft still fits (anchors, apply) and installs, and records it; verifying behavior is the agent's job, with the project's own tests.

- The `oracle` frontmatter field is gone. An existing `oracle:` block is ignored with the warning `frontmatter/oracle-ignored`: move the check into the project's tests and say under Invariants which tests cover each one.
- `graft verify` is removed, and `graft add` no longer scaffolds `oracle.mjs` (or takes `--modes`). `runOracle` is gone from core; `runCommand` now lives in `command.ts`.
- Sync reports no oracle output; a standalone (repo-mode) graft's result is reported as `materialized` (with a `fetch` ref) instead of under `oracle`.
- The graft-sync skill makes verification explicit: prove every Invariant with the project's tests before recording a variant, add a test where none covers one, never weaken a test.
- The GitHub Action's PRs say Graft checked fit, not behavior, and its agent prompts ask the agent to verify the Invariants with the project's tests and report how.
