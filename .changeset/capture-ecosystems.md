`graft capture` works for Cargo, Go and PyPI grafts.

- cargo: captures the copy cargo builds, the vendored crate after `graft apply` (or the registry source); `target/` and `.cargo-ok` are ignored.
- go: captures the module's replacement directory, the vendored module after `graft apply` or any directory a `replace` points at. The read-only module cache is refused with `capture/read-only`, saying where to edit instead. Variant files are named `v0.11.0.patch`, not `vv0.11.0.patch`.
- pypi: captures the wheel's own files in site-packages (its top-level packages and modules, including files added there), never the rest of site-packages, `.dist-info`, `.data` or `__pycache__`.
- In every ecosystem, capture refuses an installed copy that is exactly pristine + the selected variant (`capture/no-changes`), instead of registering a duplicate of that variant.
