Patch grafts for Rust crates, Go modules and Python packages (#26).

- `rootstock.ecosystem` (`npm` by default, so existing grafts are unchanged; `cargo`, `go`, `pypi`), with `frontmatter/unknown-ecosystem` for anything else. Versions and ranges use the ecosystem's scheme: semver for npm, cargo and go (the `v` optional), PEP 440 for pypi.
- cargo: the published `.crate` is the pristine artifact; the `cargo-vendor` applier commits the patched crate under `.grafts/.vendor/` and adds `[patch.crates-io]`, and `graft check` fails on `[[patch.unused]]`, which cargo only warns about.
- go: the module cache's verified copy is the pristine artifact; the `go-replace` applier commits the patched module and sets a version-qualified `replace` (go.mod or go.work), and `graft check` fails when the go command ignores it.
- pypi: the published wheel is the pristine artifact; the `wheel-vendor` applier commits the patched wheel and points `[tool.uv.sources]` (uv) or the requirements file (pip) at it, reinstalling so that neither tool keeps a stale copy silently. Poetry isn't supported yet.
- `graft add --ecosystem`, per-ecosystem options under `ecosystems` in `.grafts/config.json`, and `mechanisms.patch.applier` per ecosystem. Reports and `outdated` carry the ecosystem. The `fork` mechanism's package mode stays npm only (`fork/ecosystem`).
